    <Highlight>Computer vision</Highlight> encompasses quite a large variety of tasks
    but in a nutshell we could say that computer vision tasks try to emulate animal
    vision. The computer receives images or videos as input and and is expected to
    processes those in a useful manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Broadly speaking many computer vision tasks can be subdivided into 3 major
    tasks.

  <p>Image Classification</p>

  <p>Object Detection</p>
  <p>Semantic Segmentation</p>
