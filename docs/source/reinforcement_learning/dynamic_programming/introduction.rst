The algorithms that I am going to cover in this section are not those that are commonly used to solve reinforcement learning tasks. In fact there is no learning involved at all. Dynamic Programming (DP) requires the full knowledge of the model of the environment and calculates the optimal value function and policy through the knowledge of that model. The interaction between the agent and the environment is not necessary. Nevertheless Dynamic Programming is the usual introduction to the solution of finite MDPs, because the knowledge gained by studying DP algorithms is transferable to reinforcement learning.
