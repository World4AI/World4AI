In order to find a solution to a reinforcement learning problem the first step should be to formalize the problem in a mathematical framework. This allows researchers and practitioners to study the properties of the problem and to prove that certain types of solutions are guaranteed to have certain properties. In reinforcement learning the tool that is commonly used for those purposes is the Markov decision process (MDP). 

Many of the components of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) were already introduced in one of the previous chapters. The main focus of those chapters was the building of an intuitive foundation. In the following chapters I am going to reiterate the already introduced material, but the focus is going to be on the more formal explanations of MDPs. The mathematics that is going to be introduced in the next chapters will form the basis of much of reinforcement learning.
