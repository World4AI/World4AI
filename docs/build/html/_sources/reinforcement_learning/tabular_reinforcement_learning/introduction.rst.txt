Finite Markov Decision Processes have finite State, Action and Reward sets. This allows for the implementation of state-value and action-value functions that can be stored in lists or tables. Those implementations are appropriately called tabular methods. The current state of the art reinforcement learning rarely deals with tabular methods any more, but it is still more convenient to start the exploration of reinforcement learning techniques with those, as the general ideas are extremely relevant to modern (approximative) methods which are going to be introduced in following sections.
