=================================
Epsilon(:math:`\epsilon`)-Greedy
=================================

Epsilon-Greedy is on the one hand the easiest strategy to balance exploration and exploitation and on the other hand probably the most common one.

With the probability of :math:`\epsilon` the agent selects the greedy action and with the probability of :math:`1 - \epsilon` the agent selects a random action. Often :math:`\epsilon` is not constant and starts with a relatively high value to encourage exploration when the agent knows nothing about the environment. The value is decreased over time and reaches a final minimal value after a designated number of steps. The minimal value often lies in the range between 0.01 and 0.1.
