The naive implementation of approximate reinforcement learning algorithms can diverge, especially when combining non-linear function approximators, temporal difference learning and off-policy learning. Yet particularly over the last decade researchers have developed techniques to reduce the probability of divergence dramatically. They made the techniques more sample efficient and more stable. These are the algorithms we are going to study in the next few chapters.
