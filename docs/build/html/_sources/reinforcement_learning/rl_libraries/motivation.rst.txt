During your introduction into the world of reinforcement learning you should not spend your time reinventing the wheel. The use of common libraries saves time and allows you to compare your results without the fear that the differences are based on different implementation details of the base libraries. 

The availability of good reinforcement learning libraries has grown over the last couple of years. DeepMind, OpenAI or independent entities and individuals publish their code and compete with each other for the attention of the users. It seems that the popularity of their projects is a matter of pride and reputation. The code is published with an open-source license, which allows the users to report bugs and contribute to the development of their favourite library. 

The problem nowadays is not the lack of good libraries, but the lack of good entry level materials. Even if documentation is available it is often not beginner friendly and in some cases the original documentation is counter productive. The intention of this section is to remedy the problem by providing beginner level tutorial style introductions. The hope is that after the short tutorial the motivated reader will be able to follow the official library documentation and get the necessary information when the need arises.
