  <p>Generative models allow you to generate new data, like music, images and even movie clips. This is one of the fastes moving areas in the deep learning industry at the moment. Just a couple of years ago it was unimaginable that you can generate such high quality content from a deep learning model. For example models like <a target="_blank" href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALLÂ·E 2</a> and <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release" target="_blank">Stable Diffusion</a> allow you to generate images based on some text input and more and more text to video research papers are released. It is only a matter of time until we see the first deep learning movie blockbuster.</p>
  <p>In this chapter we will follow the same strategy that we have also applied in previous chapters. We will study the theory and implement some of the models from scratch. Afterwards we will switch to modern open source pretrained models and learn how we can apply those.</p>
