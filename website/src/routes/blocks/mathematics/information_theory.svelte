<p>
  Information theory might seem like an unlikely subject to be covered in a
  machine learning course, but this notion changes quickly once you start
  developing models and realize that even the task of classifying cats and dogs
  with the help of a neural networks contains a big chunk of information theory.

<p>
  Commonly information theory is defined as a field that deals with the
  quantification of information, but the related concepts of data compression
  and data transmission also commonly turn up in the definition of information
  theory. We are going to start this journey with the way to quantify
  information.
