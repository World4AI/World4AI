  <p>
    Linear regression can be regarded as the basis for logistic regression.
    Unlike the name suggests though, logistic regression is commonly used for
    classification and not regression tasks. More than that, we will discover
    that logistic regression should actually be regarded as a non-linear neuron.
    The study of logistic regression should therefore provide us with the
    building blocks that will eventually allow us to construct neural networks.
