<p>
  Linear regression can be regarded as the basis for logistic regression. Unlike
  the name suggests though, logistic regression is commonly used for
  classification and not regression tasks. More than that, we will discover that
  logistic regression should actually be regarded as a non-linear neuron. The
  study of logistic regression should therefore provide us with the building
  blocks that will eventually allow us to construct neural networks.
