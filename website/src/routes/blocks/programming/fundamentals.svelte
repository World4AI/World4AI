<p>In this chapter we are going to delve into the core fundamentals of the Python programming language. It is intended mostly for a beginner level student, but feel free to browse through the material even if you consider yourself an advanced user, you never know what you might learn. The general Python setup, printing statements to the console, variables, operators, commenting and data types are among the topics that we need to be comfortable with before we can start practicing machine learning. The idea is to build the foundation brick by brick in order to advance to more complex topics.</p>
