<h1>Python setup</h1>

<p><em>How can you setup Python?</em></p>
<div class="separator"></div>

<p>There are probably a dozen ways to run Python. The setup process depends on whether you want to run Python locally or in the cloud. For a beginner it makes sense to create an online account with one of the cloud services. The process is usually hassle-free and the likelihood of giving up because of the setup process is relatively low compared to the local installation. Intermediate and advanced users on the other hand should be able to install and manage Python on many different systems. Especially when you intend to deploy your machine learning models on the web it is essential to know how to setup Python and the required packages on a Linux distribution.</p>

<h2>Python in the cloud</h2>

<p>If you start out and would like to jump into coding, a cloud provider is a great choice.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://replit.com/">replit</a> is free to use, but requires registration.</li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.online-python.com/">ONLINE PYTHON</a> is still in beta, but does not require any form of registration.</li> 
</ul>

<p>If you don't know where to start, choose one of the above options. You can switch to a local setup, once you have mastered the basics of Python.</p>
