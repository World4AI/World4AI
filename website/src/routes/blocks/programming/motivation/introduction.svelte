<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><em>Why is programming important for artificial intelligence?</em></p>
<div class="separator"></div>

<p>The reason we start our artificial intelligencence journey with an introduction to programming is a pragmatic one. The blocks that follow: math, deep learning and reinforcement learning heavily rely on programming. It is not an overstatement to say that artificial intelligence without programming can not exists. This block is going to build a foundation upon which we will rely for the rest of the course. It is most likely that you do not have to finish the whole block to be able to start any of the next blocks, but we require you to have a certain basic knowledge of programming concepts. If you notice, that your understanding of the code is lacking you can return here and take a deeper dive here or use your search engine of choice to find the answers on your own.</p>
