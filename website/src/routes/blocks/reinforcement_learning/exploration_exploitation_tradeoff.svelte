<p>
  When the model of the environment is not available or the model is too complex
  it becomes essential for the agent to explore the environment through
  interaction. The necessity for interaction and exploration creates problems
  that are native to reinforcement learning. We need to create agents that are
  able to collect new experiences, that is to explore the environment, and that
  are able to use the knowledge to optimize the reward stream, that is to
  exploit the learned knowledge. Once the agent decides to exploit or to explore
  there is no turning back and he has to live with the consequences. This gives
  rise to the so-called exploration-exploitation dilemma, which states that at
  each time step either exploration or exploitation is possible, but definitely
  not both. In this chapter we are going to delve into the balancing act that is
  the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.
