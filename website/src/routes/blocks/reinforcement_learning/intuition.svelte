<Question>How can we start learning reinforcement learning?</Question>
<div class="separator" />

<p>
  A big chunk of machine learning is mathematics and reinforcement learning is
  no exception. Often we can lose track of what we are actually trying to solve
  and lose ourselves in the definitions and mathematics. This chapter is inteded
  to give an intuitive introduction into the topic of reinforcement learning
  without any rigourous proofs. The intention of the chapter is to elicit
  excitement and passion and to show that under all those calculations lie
  simple but powerful ideas. Still all the knowledge learned in this chapter is
  going to be useful for when we start dealing with math and programming.
