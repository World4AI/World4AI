    <p>
      World4AI is organized into building blocks. Each block forms knowledge
      that is fundamental to modern artificial intelligence.

      We intend to cover the basics of deep learning, symbolic ai, neurosciece
      and much more, but at the moment only a few sections have been started and
      none is considered finalized. More chapters will be published in the next
      weeks and months. But the overall process will most likely take many
      years.

        <h2>Mathematics</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Mathematics is the foundation for all artificial intelligence. If you
          want to understand AI in depth, you will need to invest some time into
          this block. Be aware though, that you do not need to work through all
          of mathematics in order to start learning AI. You can always come back
          here.

        <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Most of the recent successes in artificial intelligence is due to deep
          learning. Computer vision, natural language processing, generative
          art, board games and many more areas have been taken over by deep
          neural networks. Yet all those achievements will pale in comparison to
          those that will surely come in the next decades. This is a fascinating
          area to explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The block is suited for absolute beginners, but exposure to linear
          algebra, probability theory, calculus and Python is assumed.

        <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          A reasonable way to think about reinforcement learning is to think
          about animals whom you would like to teach good behaviour and
          discourage from bad behaviour. The way you would go about it would
          probably involve some reward when the animal behaves the way you
          desire and punishment when it doesnâ€™t.
        </p>
        <p>
          This block is suited for beginners, but we rely on some fundamental
          knowledge of deep learning for more advanced topics.

        <h2>Neuroscience</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Neuroscience is the study of the human brain. While this topic might
          not be absolutely necessary to understand AI, there are a lot of
          lessons that we can learn about AI by studying the only organ capable
          of complex behaviour, the human brain.
