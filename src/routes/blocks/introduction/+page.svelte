      World4AI is organized into building blocks. Each block forms knowledge
      that is fundamental to modern artificial intelligence.

      We intend to cover the basics of deep learning, symbolic ai, neurosciece
      and much more, but at the moment only a few sections have been started and
      none is considered finalized. More chapters will be published in the next
      weeks and months. But the overall process will most likely take many
      years.

      Computer vision, natural language processing, generative art, board games
      and many more areas have been taken over by deep learning. Once it became
      clear that we can scale neural networks to improve the performance in a
      particular area, other methods became obsolete. Within a decade from the
      so called ImageNet moment in 2012, deep learning became ubiquitous.
      Nowadays our mobile phones make sure that the pictures you take with your
      mobile phone are as crisp as those taken with a professional camera,
      recommendation systems like those used by Netflix or Spotify do a great
      job at finding new products based on your consumption history and Alexa by
      Amazon can understand your actual speach and trigger actions based on your
      words. Yet all those achievements will pale in comparison to those that
      will surely come in the next decades. Often it feels like we just barely
      scratched the surface of what is actually possible with those systems.
      This is an exciting time to study deep learning and this website will
      hopefully become a stepping stone in your journey towards deep learning
      mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this block we are going to take a deep dive into deep learning. We will
      study the very first artificial neurons that were developed in the 1950's,
      the progress towards multilayer neural networks with the help of the
      backpropagation algorithm as well as state of the art deep learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The block is suited for absolute beginners and we do not assume any prior
      knowledge of deep learning, but exposure to linear algebra, probability
      theory and calculus is assumed. We also expect fundamental Python
      knowledge, as theoretical lectures will be accompanied by practical Python
      books and exercises.

    <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
    <Alert type="warning">
      The block has been started, but this is very early work in progress.
    </Alert>
    <p>
      A reasonable way to think about reinforcement learning is to think about
      animals whom you would like to teach good behaviour and discourage from
      bad behaviour. The way you would go about it would probably involve some
      reward when the animal behaves the way you desire and punishment when it
      doesnâ€™t.

      Let's consider mice in a maze that get food once they arrive at the goal.
      The amount of food could depend on the time a mouse needs to complete the
      maze. If the mouse takes the blue path, the route is relatively straight
      forward and the mouse ends up at the goal without any delays. The red path
      on the other hand leads to a dead end, which forces the mouse to retrace
      the steps. Over time the mouse will learn the shourtest route which
      maximizes the amount of food.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reinforcement learning we similarly deal with agents which have to
      learn certain behaviour. The world (environment) that the agent interacts
      with provides reinforcement in form of numeric rewards which can be used
      to learn the desired behaviour.
