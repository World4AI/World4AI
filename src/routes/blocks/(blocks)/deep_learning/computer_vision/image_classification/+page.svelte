    In this section we are finally going to encounter convolutional neural
    networks and use them for image classification. But the theory and practice
    is not limited to classification, the same techinques are going to be
    extended to object detection and image segmentation in a later step.

    Still to this day convolutional neural networks produce state of the art
    results in image recognition. At this point we are literally on the verge of
    delving into modern research papers to reproduce the state of the art.
