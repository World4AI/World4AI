  <p>
    All World4AI examples and exercises are developed with the help of the deep
    leanring package PyTorch. To bring you up to speed, this chapter is
    exclusively dedicated to fundamental PyTorch knowledge. We are going to
    cover the fundamental Tensor class, the autograd package, the Dataset and
    DataLoader classes. At the end of this chapter we will implement a full
    training loop and try to classify handwritten digits.
