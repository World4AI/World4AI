    <h1>What is World4AI?</h1>
    <p>World4AI is my answer to the question “How can I push my knowledge in artificial intelligence to an intermediary level, when I start out as a complete beginner?”. World4AI was designed with the philosophy "learning by teaching" in mind, so the main purpose of this website is to have a personalized blog that I can utilize to learn about AI.</p>
    <Alert type="warning">At the moment only a few sections have been written. The whole website is still a work in progress.</Alert>
