# World4AI

[World4AI](https://world4ai.org) is an interactive online book designed to learn different areas of artificial intelligence. 

⚠️ The website is still in the early stages of development and is expected to change over the next weeks, months and years. 

## Main Ideas

* Learn AI through animations, interactive examples, intuition, math and coding exercises
* Learn different areas of AI, e.g. deep Learning and symbolic AI
* The book is always work in progress, aim for continuous improvement 
* Practical examples and exercises accompany the book 

## Main Libraries


* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
* [KaTeX](https://katex.org/)

## World4AI Roadmap 2022 (and beyond)

For the time being we are focusing on deep learning. 
Some of the sections have already reached a working state and can be used to study.
