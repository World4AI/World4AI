# World4AI

[World4AI](https://world4ai.org) is an interactive online book designed to learn different areas of artificial intelligence.

⚠️ The website is still in the early stages of development and is expected to change over the next weeks, months and years.

## Main Ideas

- Learn AI through animations, interactive examples, intuition, math and coding exercises
- Learn different areas of AI, e.g. deep Learning and symbolic AI
- The book is always work in progress, aim for continuous improvement
- Practical examples and exercises accompany the book

## Used Libraries

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) for Front-End development
- [Pyton](https://www.python.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for deep learning

## World4AI Roadmap 2023 (and beyond)

For the time being we are focusing on deep learning.
Some of the sections have already reached a working state and can be used to study.
